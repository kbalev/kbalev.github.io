<h2>Section 1: Favourite foods.</h2>
<div><p>I like various foods but the ones that come to mind right now are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Steak</li>
    <li>Sushi</li>
    <li>Ramen</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Section 2: The Seasons</h2>
<div>
    <p>All seasons are great but I am partial to some over others.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Summer is best.</li>
        <li>Winter is a close second.</li>
        <li>Spring is basically pre-Summer so that's great.</li>
        <li>Autumn, while last, is by no means least.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<h2>Section 3: Why I joined Code Nation?</h2>
<div>
    <p>I joined CN because I wanted to change career and expand my skilset. Coding has interested me for a long while now and this seemed to be the best way to get started.</p>
</div>
<h2>Section 4: My targets</h2>
<div>
    <p>I am keen to get more hands-on experience with coding, most notably HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First I would like to finish setting up the website you are currently reading and getting it to work like I want.</li>
        <li>Secondly, I would like to format it in a way that the cat at the top is not taking up the entire screen. If the cat is smaller than half the page, I have succeeded.</li>
    </ul>
